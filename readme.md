## Few words on project

this project is a fun idea with using a threejs spheregeometry and adding 360degrees photos I've taken with my drone to use as material on the backside of the sphere.

then I placed the camera at center og the sphere. and change the orbit controls setting so it would lock the view exept turning around.
